h1. Last.fm API

This API will construct the appropriate Last.fm API URL to query. You need to bring your own "fetching":http://requestcore.googlecode.com, and you'll probably want some "caching":http://cachecore.googlecode.com too for performance.

Because of the way that Last.fm handles authenticated requests, no extra work needs to be done at the API-level to support these requests. You will, however, need to manage your authentication tokens in your app as this API doesn't (and shouldn't) do that.

h2. Setup

You can rename <code>config-sample.inc.php</code> to <code>config.inc.php</code> and add your key/secret there, or you can pass your key/secret key to the constructor.

I would recommend the former over the latter if you generally only use on key/secret set.

h2. Example usage

If you want to make a request to Last.fm's <code>album.getInfo</code> method for "Motion City Soundtrack's":http://www.last.fm/music/Motion+City+Soundtrack ""Even If It Kills Me":http://www.last.fm/music/Motion+City+Soundtrack/Even+If+It+Kills+Me" album, you'd do the following:

"http://gist.github.com/218408":http://gist.github.com/218408
